# üêÜ JagTech E-Commerce Website 

Our motivation for developing this system is to be able to provide affordable computers for students. Another reason behind developing this system is put good use of hardware that is not being used by the Information Technology Department. The proposed system will allow students to purchase surplused inventory from the IT department at an affordable price. This system is intended for students and faculty who are associated with the University either through enrollment or employment.

# Authentication

## Login
![Login](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105807191/230662427-6d01d3ac-b714-417f-ac6d-81af1fd2ec99.png)

The Login Page requires users to enter their System ID and Password to access their account. If the information that is provided is incorrect, a message will appear notifying the user of the error. If users forgot their password, they can click on the ‚Äôforgot password‚Äô link. The forgot password link is a dead link, we did not create a system that can handle password resets. It will be left for future implementation. For those who do not have an account, they can click the ‚ÄôCreate an Account‚Äô link to register. The page also includes a ‚ÄôReturn to homepage‚Äô button that allows users to navigate back to the homepage.

## Sign-Up

The Create Account Page allows users to easily create an account by providing their First name, Last name, Email, System ID, and Password. After entering their information, they can create their account or log in using the provided link. Every error is handled through a JavaScript query selector that activates through an event handler when information changes in the query. If the inputted information is wrong or incomplete, a CSS error is displayed, and the button remains disabled. If the System ID entered is not exactly 8 digits long, the CSS error class will be applied using JavaScript, and the button will remain inactive until the correct digit count is implemented. This same process is applied to email, password, and confirm password.
