    <p>
        Most, if not all of our products have been labelled by the University of North Texas
        at Dallas Office of Information Technology as "surplus" meaning that they will not be
        under University use any longer. Please note that most of our inventory has been
        pre-owned or refurbished to some capacity. Our team conducts various testing on each
        one of our products to make sure that they meet the demands of the average student.
        Any purchase made through our company's website will be picked up at the OIT HelpDesk
        behind the Starbucks. You must provide proof of purchase before receiving your order.
        No shipping and handling offered at this time. All purchases are final.
